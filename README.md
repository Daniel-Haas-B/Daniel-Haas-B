- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

- I have a master's degree in computational physics by the University of Oslo. The topic of my thesis was machine learning methods for quantum many-body problems.
- I work as an AI Engineer at 3D-Components, where I develop machine learning models and software solutions for robotic metal 3D printing.
- I'm tryingo to get more involved in open-source projects since I align especially with Python open-source comunity. Itâ€™s a great way for me to learn, grow, and hopefully contribute to helping others along the way.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: shoot an email to danielhaas.lima@gmail.com
- I also have this slightly [outdated page](https://daniel-haas-b.github.io/) with some work and facts about me!
